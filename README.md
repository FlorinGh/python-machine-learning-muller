# Machine Learning with Python

This is repository is part of the machine learning program.  
The purpose of this project is to help build knowledge and experience in machine learning concepts.

### The language of choice is Python.  

Python has become the lingua franca for many data science applications. It combines the power of general-purpose programming languages with the ease of use of domain-specific scripting languages like MATLAB or R.  

Python has libraries for data loading, visualisations, statistics, natural language processing, imgae processing and more. This vast toolbox provides data scientists with a large array of general- and special-purpose functionality.  
One of the main advantages of using Python is the ability to interact directly with the code, using a terminal or other tools like the Jupyter Notebook.  

Machine learning and data analysis are fundamentally interative processes in which the data drives the analysis. It is essential for these processes to have tools that allow quick iteration and easy interaction.  

As a general-purpose programming language, Python also allows for the creation of complex graphical user interfaces (GUIs), web services, and for integration into existing systems.
